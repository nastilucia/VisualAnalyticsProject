# VisualAnalyticsProject
We build an interactive map of USA by using d3, javascript, html, and css.
The aim of the project is to show, by state, the agriculture intensity. We show this feature by using color. 
Clicking on a specific State, it will appear a bar chart showing how agriculture (in that state) is w.r.t one of the main crops production (Corn, Wheat, Soybeans, Cotton, Hay). 
In addition, we show the coordinates of the 10 cities where the community garden are getting popular.
